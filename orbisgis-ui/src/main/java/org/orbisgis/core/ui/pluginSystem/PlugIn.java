/**
 * From OpenJump Project
 * 
 * <p> Plug-ins are code modules that can be easily added to or
 * removed from OrbisGIS Workbench. For example, each menu item in the
 * OrbisGIS Workbench is a PlugIn. Typically plug-ins are executed with a
 * menu item -- FeatureInstaller has methods for adding plug-ins as
 * menu items. Alternatively, a plug-in need not be associated with a
 * menu-item; it might, for example, simply run some code when the
 * Workbench starts up.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * "Built-in" plug-ins are configured in a Setup class. Third-party plug-ins reside
 * in a JAR file that also contains an Extension class that configures them.
 * During development, third-party plug-ins may be specified in the
 * workbench-properties.xml file, to avoid having to build a JAR file.
 * </p>
